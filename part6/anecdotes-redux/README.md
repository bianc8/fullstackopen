# Anecdotes Redux

Create a React Frontend to be able to **vote** a list of anecdotes and sort them by **most votes** (continue of /part1)

## Functionalities:

- Use **json-server** as backend

- **Filter** anecdotes

- Show a **notification** for 5 seconds, after an action has been made

- Create new Anecdotes

- Save the state on a **Redux** store

- Separate the action-objects to async **action-creators** functions

- Use of **multiple reducers**

- Know how to use the Redux **connect**-function instead of useDispatch/useSelector
